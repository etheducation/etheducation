      <p>The Compound protocol lets you deposit cryptoassets like ETH and USDC. You'll be rewarded for these deposits by earning inteest, similar to a savings account at your traditional bank. The Compound Protocol often gives higher interest rates than your bank. Sometimes, these interest rates get as high as 20% APY. Meanwhile, the average traditional bank savings account in the US currenlty only pays {averageTraditionalBankAPY.toFixed(2)}%. Compound also lets you take out loans, but we'll get to that in another quest.</p>
      <p>First, you'll need to give the Compound protocol the ability to withdraw your funds.</p>

      <p>Awesome, now we can get to the real fun. Compound lets you earn interest on many types of cryptoassets. In this case, we'll deposit USDC. 1 USDC = $1 USD, so it's easier to compare to a traditional savings account. Once your USDC is deposited in Compound, you can't send it to others. The USDC is "locked" in Compound until you withdraw it.</p>

      <p>You earn interest every block. In the {earnings.block - deposit.block} blocks since you deposited, your balance has grown {earnings.usdcEarned} USDC, from {deposit.amount} USDC to {deposit.amount+earnings.usdcEarned} USDC. Youâ€™ve also earned {earnings.compEarned} COMP, the governance token. You can do xyz with the token, or exchange it for USDC on Uniswap.</p>

      <p>You might be wondering where your interest income is coming from. In a traditional bank savings account, the bank lends out your money to other people for them to buy homes. You're money is safe because if those people stop paying, the bank takes back their house and sells it. The Compound Protocol works in a similar fashion. But, it has stricter rules about when it lends out money and what happens if a borrower doesn't pay their loan. using youThis section is all about the technical TODO, talk about the asset pools and collaterlaization ratios.</p>
